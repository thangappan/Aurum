Dependency module

	django-oauth2-provider 

User will be created in django along with client ( client_id, client_secret)

To create access tokens need 

	* username
	* password
	* grant_type
	* scope
	* client_id
	* client_secret

	The final request would like the following one

	 curl -d "client_id=06b4bd0862afbdea3d61*client_secret=a0ff4f0b89ce9313de9a92b66a0e5c08d3b32379&grant_type=password&username=aurum&password=aurum&scope=write"  http://138.12.21.232:8000/oauth2/access_token

	This will give response with client token and that can be used for accessing our aurum API

	{"access_token": "6f5c27ebf5a8d24c1c058d2182a9ab2c414d0117", "scope": "read write read+write", "expires_in": 31535999, "refresh_token": "52ae31b3dbf7f570bab702bb1d54ed52e2b6009e"}
